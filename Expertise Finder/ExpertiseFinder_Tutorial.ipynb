    "# Welcome !\n",
    "This CoLab notebook is a walkthough on how to use my function **expertiseFinder_NameOrInst()** *(plus some bonus functions)* in the .py file **ExpertiseFinder_MSI.py**. The purpose of this function is to determine researchers at a specific institutions that have a presence in the ADS NASA database. The \"Expertise Finder\" detects what researchers are from the target institution by querying NASA ADS using the institution name, then pulling out the author name of papers whose first author is affiliated with the target institution. The code then focuses on their astronomical expertise through selecting publication in astronomical journals (e.g. ApJ, MNRAS, SPIE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this tutorial is to walk the user through the process of using said function on provided data files and prepare them for using the function on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The items you will need to run this code are listed below:\n",
    "1. The file **ExpertiseFinder_MSI.py**.\n",
    "2. The supporting file **TextAnalysis.py**.\n",
    "3. A file of ignorable \"stop words\" and its directory path in Google Drive: **stopwords.csv**.\n",
    "4. For the BONUS section, the file **NHFPFellows_Sample.csv** as an input.\n",
    "5. Your own **NASA ADS API token**. This is a long string of characters generated by ADS that gives you acces to their API. You can find instructions on how to get an ADS token [here](https://ads.readthedocs.io/en/v1/api-key.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure you have these items available before starting this tutorial. If you do not have access to these files, please contact maire.volz@nasa.gov or antonino.cucchiara@nasa.gov. Thank you !\n"
