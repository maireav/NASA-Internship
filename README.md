# NASA-Internship
This repository contains the final deliverables of the three seasons of my NASA Internship, from Summer 2022 to Spring 2023.

Below is a brief description of the contents of each folder:
- Expertise Finder: Code built for determining the astronomical expertise of an individual by analyzing the results of queries on NASA ADS. Contains the files needed to run all versions of my "Expertise Finder" function.
- Fellow and Institution Map: With the primary deliverable being an HTML file, this folder contains the code needed to recreate a map of NASA Hubble Fellowship Program participants and nearby Minority Serving Institutions and R2 Universities in the US.
- Institution Classification: Using information from the Carnegie Classification of Institutes of Higher Education, this code classifies both universities and other types into homogenized research classification categories and Minority Serving Institution status. The folder contains necessary functions and spreadsheets to run the "Carnegie Matching" function.
- Success Percent and Rate: This folder contains the necessary functions to determine pre-DAPR and post-DAPR differences in NASA proposal acceptance rates.
